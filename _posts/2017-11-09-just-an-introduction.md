*Just wanted to drop a quick introduction about me and what I want to write for the future on that blog.*

There's a long time since I told to myself that I'd write about my adventures in the Developer world.
But, I've been procrastinating for a long time and I've just decided to start today! yaaay!!

Actually I felt afraid for a long time too, because I didn't know that much as I would like to know.
But, everyone has some good things to share even though that things and I just left my fears aside.
Then I'm here and I want to challenge you to do the same that I'm doing now. Actually I've never written in English for a blog neither in Portuguese.
By the way Portuguese is my first language, then I'll write articles in Portuguese as well.
