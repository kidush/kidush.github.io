*Just wanted to drop a quick introduction about me and what I want to write for the future on that blog.*

There's a long time since I told to myself that I'd write about my adventures in the Developer's world.
But, I've been procrastinating for a long time and I've just decided to start today! yaaay!!

Actually I felt afraid for a long time too, because I didn't know that much as I would like to know.
But, everyone has some good things to share even though that things you want to share are not "Big" enough as you wanted. So, I've just left my fears aside.
Then I'm here and I want to challenge you to do the same that I'm doing now. Actually I've never written in English for a blog neither in any language haha.
By the way Portuguese is my first language, then I'll write articles in Portuguese as well.
