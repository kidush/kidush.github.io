I'm a Full Stack Developer despite the fact that I like to work much more as a Back-end Developer 
than a Front-end Developer. 

I'm a Father of two kids and husband of a beautiful wife. Sometimes I try to be a musician and
I like to play bass in the most of the time that I'm playing in my church's band. Sometimes I try to sing as well LOL. 
 
Well, let's keep going... I'm a Developer for over 5 years now and since I was a kid I've always been passionate 
about everything in technology even more when technologies were related to video games.
So, I think it guides my career to get this far. 

I started my career as a PHP Developer and I worked with it for over three years, after that I've felt in love with Ruby and Ruby on Rails. 
Then, I've been working a lot with Ruby ever since and I can say it is my favorite language. 
Despite the fact that I'm dealing with Back-end stuff in the most of the time 
I really like to work with Javascript. I also have a experience with Devops and Sysadmin stuff.
